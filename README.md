This research project investigates the pronunciation, origin, and cultural significance of place names across Florida. Many Florida place names are derived from Indigenous, Spanish, Anglo, or other linguistic roots and are frequently mispronounced. Our goal is to explore these names and present them in a fun and educational way.

The project is led by Dr. Moulay Anwar Sounny-Slitine, with research contributions from Gemma Egan and Emily Mancha.
